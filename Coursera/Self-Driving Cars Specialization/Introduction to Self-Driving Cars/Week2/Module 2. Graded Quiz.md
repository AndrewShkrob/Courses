1. What are the differences between **exteroceptive sensors** and **proprioceptive sensors**? (Select all that apply)
>    * Proprioceptive sensors do not interact with the environment, whereas exteroceptive sensors do.
>    * Exteroceptive sensors can determine obstacle size and distance away, whereas proprioceptive sensors cannot.
___
2. Which of the following exteroceptive sensors would you use in **harsh sunlight**?
>    * Radar
>    * Sonar
___
3. Why is synchronization and timing accuracy important in the self driving system? **Choose the primary reason**.
>    * Synchronization is important to ensure correct sensor fusion.
___
4. Your autonomous vehicle is driving on the German autobahn at 150 km/h and you wish to maintain safe following distances with other vehicles. Assuming a safe following distance of 2s, **what is the distance (in m) required between vehicles**? Round your answer to **2 decimal places**.
>    * 83.33
___
5. Using the same speed of 150 km/h, **what is the braking distance (in m) required for emergency stops**? Assume an aggressive deceleration of 5 m/s^2. Round your answer to **2 decimal places**.
>    * 173.61
___
6. Suppose your vehicle was using long range cameras for sensing forward distance, but it is now nighttime and the images captured are too dark. **Which of the following sensors can be used to compensate**?
>    * Lidar
>    * Radar
___
7. What are the differences between an **occupancy grid** and a **localization map**? (Select all that apply)
>    * An occupancy grid uses a dense representation of the environment, whereas a localization map does not need to be dense.
>    * The localization map is primarily used to estimate the vehicle position, whereas the occupancy grid is primarily used to plan collision free paths.
___
8. The vehicle steps through the software architecture and arrives at the controller stage. What information is required for the **controller** to output its commands to the vehicle?
>    * Planned paths
>    * Vehicle state
___
9. What is (are) the role(s) of the **system supervisor**? (Select all that apply)
>    * To ensure that the sensors are working correctly
>    * To ensure that the maps update at the correct frequencies
___
10. Which of the following tasks should be assigned to the **local planner**?
>    * Planning to avoid a parked car in the ego vehicle's lane  
___
11. What common objects in the environment appear in the **occupancy grid**?
>    * Parked vehicles
___
12. Which of the following maps contain **roadway speed limits**?
